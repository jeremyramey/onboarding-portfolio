  <h1>Customer Onboarding &amp; Implementation Portfolio</h1>

  <p>
    This repository is a working portfolio that reflects how I approach SaaS onboarding and implementations—from kickoff through customer independence.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is not a code-focused repository. Instead, it contains structured documentation, examples, and artifacts that demonstrate how I organize onboarding work, communicate clearly with customers, and execute implementations with consistency and discipline.
  </p>

  <h2>What This Portfolio Represents</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>How onboarding engagements are structured from kickoff to launch</li>
    <li>How processes, decisions, and customer-facing guidance are documented</li>
    <li>How scope, timelines, and delivery expectations are protected</li>
    <li>How complex workflows are translated into clear, actionable steps</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The emphasis throughout is execution clarity—not theory.
  </p>

  <h2>My Approach to Onboarding</h2>

  <p>
    My onboarding philosophy is centered on ownership, structure, and momentum. Every onboarding moment is an opportunity to either build confidence or introduce friction.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Clear ownership from kickoff through go-live</li>
    <li>Defined milestones and success criteria</li>
    <li>Early enablement of admins and end users</li>
    <li>A fast, deliberate path to customer independence</li>
    <li>Strong alignment with Product, Engineering, and Customer Success</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How This Repository Is Intended to Be Used</h2>

  <p>
    If you are reviewing this as a hiring manager or founder, this repository is best viewed as a snapshot of how I structure and communicate onboarding work in practice.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>An emphasis on clarity, sequencing, and decision-making</li>
    <li>Examples of simplifying complex systems and workflows</li>
    <li>A focus on communication quality as much as content</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These materials reflect how I run real onboarding engagements with customers and internal teams.
